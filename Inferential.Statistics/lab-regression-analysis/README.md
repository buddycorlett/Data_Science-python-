# Lab | Regression Analysis


## Introduction

As a data analyst, regression analysis is one of the most fundamental and very powerful prediction and classification techniques that can be used. Multiple linear regression is widely used for prediction problems while logistic regression is a very important classification technique. In this exercise we will use both these techniques along with learning how to manage numerical and categorical variables to get more accurate predictions. 

This lab has two challenges, namely:
Challenge 1 : Multiple Linear Regression
Challenge 2 : Logistic Regression

## Getting Started

Go to the folder lab-regression-analysis in the GitHub repo. Open the files `lab-regression-analysis-Challenge 1.ipynb` and `lab-regression-analysis-Challenge 2.ipynb` in the `your-code` directory. In each challenge, please read the question carefully and provide your solutions below the question. The dataset to be used in the exercises has been provided on GitHub here.

Please refer the notes. 

Happy Learning!!

## Deliverables
